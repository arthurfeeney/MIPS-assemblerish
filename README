uses MIPS instruction set, but I have implemented some things differently. For instance, all address offsets are just c++ offsets. So scooching over in an array of ints: instead of incrementing address by +4, it just does +1.

basically works.

Big TODOs:
0*. Think of better way to do arithmetic operations to addresses.
1. fix broken commands 
1.5 make some more advanced tests.
1.5 Refactor poorly written parts.
2. implement repl type thing.

how to run a file:
    1. load <file name> (only works for 1 file rn)
    2. run / step / stc(run just runs it. step prints out binary, the 
    instruction, and values in registers. stc is step to complete. It steps
    through the program without having to type step for every command.)
    3. boom! get output!

Definitely still a big work in progress
