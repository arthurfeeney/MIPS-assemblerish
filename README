uses MIPS instruction set, but I have implemented some differently to make things easier for myself. (Like all address offsets are just c++ offsets)

basically works...

Big TODOs:
-Need to do a real test of all of the commands. 
-Think of a way to actually load data address and not just use a pointer to a value in data segment...
-make some more advanced test functions.

how to run a file:
    1. load <file name> (only works for 1 file rn)

    2. run / step (run just runs it, step prints out binary, the instruction, 
    and values in registers)
    
    3. boom! get output!

Definitely still a big work in progress
