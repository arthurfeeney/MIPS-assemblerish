Little to do list :)
XXX means that it is done.

ShortTerm:
XXX     1. Fix beq and bne.
            - currently point to absolute address of the jump, not offset from
            the current index.
XXX     2. Fix la
            - got it backwards or something?
XXX     3. have it write to a file instead of just printing it out.
        4. add support for all main mips commands.
            -slti
            -sltiu
            -bgtz
            -blez
            -jalr
            -lb
            -lh
            -sb
            -sh
            -mfhi
            -mflo
            -mthi
            -mtlo
            -trap (?)

        5. do a more comprehensive test.
        6. make it a bit better at handling bad inputs.
            - add some simple error outputs. 
            - assemble returns an int for error codes. 


Long Term:
    1. better support for more pseudo commands.
    2. make it a lot better at handling bad inputs.
    3. make it handle things like data segments and io stuff.  
    4. turn into an interpreter (or use it in interpreter?) <- summer project?
        - more options for how it runs. 'run' and 's' commands.
            - run runs through the program.
            - s steps through the program showing the binary of each command.
