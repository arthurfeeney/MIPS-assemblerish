Little to do list :)
XXX means that it is done.

ShortTerm:
XXX     1. Fix beq and bne.
            - currently point to absolute address of the jump, not offset from
            the current index.
XXX     2. Fix la
            - got it backwards or something?
XXX     3. have it write to a file instead of just printing it out.
XXX     4. add support for all main mips commands.


        4.5 modify the conditionals so that they are a bit more readable.
            - use a static member variable instead of a namespace.
        5. do a more comprehensive test. Make sure everything still works.
            - it probably does, but just make sure.
            - make extra sure la works and lui and ori work individually...
        6. make it a bit better at handling bad inputs.
            - add some simple error outputs.
            - assemble returns an int for error codes.
        7. support hexidecimal for immediates.
        8. refactor so that the command parts aren't ordered in the
           constructor. Just store the original string, and order things
           when to_binary is called?


Long Term:
    1. support for more pseudo commands.
    2. make it a lot better at handling bad inputs.
    3. make it handle things like data segments and io stuff(for interpreter).
    4. turn into an interpreter (or use it in interpreter?) <- summer project?
        - more options for how it runs. 'run' and 's' commands.
            - run runs through the program.
            - s steps through the program showing the binary of each command.
