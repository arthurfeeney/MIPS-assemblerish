Little to do list :)
XXX means that it is done.

ShortTerm:
XXX     1. Fix beq and bne.
            - currently point to absolute address of the jump, not offset from
            the current index.
XXX     2. Fix la
            - got it backwards or something?


XXX     3. have it write to a file instead of just printing it out.
        4. add support for all main mips commands.
        5. do a more comprehensive test.
        6. make it a bit better at handling bad inputs.


Long Term:
    1. better support for more pseudo commands.
    2. make it a lot better at handling bad inputs.
    3. turn into an interpreter. <- summer project?
