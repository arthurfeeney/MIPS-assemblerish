Little to do list :)
XXX means that it is done.

ShortTerm:
XXX 1. Fix beq and bne.
    - currently point to absolute address of the jump, not offset from
      the current index.
2. Fix la
    - got it backwards or something?
3. have it write to a file instead of just printing it out. 
4. add support for all main mips commands.
5. do a more comprehensive test.

Long Term:
    1. better support for more pseudo commands.
    2. handle bad inputs better.
    3. turn into an interpreter. <- summer project?
