Little to do list :)

ShortTerm:
1. Fix beq and bne.
    - currently point to absolute address of the jump, not offset from
      the current index.
2. Fix la
    - got it backwards or something? whatever.
3. add support for all main mips commands.

Long Term:
    - better support for more pseudo commands.
    - turn into an interpreter. <- summer project?
